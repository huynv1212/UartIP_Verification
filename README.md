# UART IP verification by using UVM
## Introduce
My name is Nguyen Van Huy, and I am a course participant at ICTC (IC Training Center Vietnam). This article presents my work on develop and validate UART IP, a final project I have completed as part of my course at ICTC. The goal of this article is to show the knowledge and skills I have gained through my studies at ICTC and to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers in the field of Design Verification.

The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (**UART**) performs **serial-to-parallel** conversion for data received from a **peripheral device** and **parallel-to-serial** conversion for data received from the **CPU**. It includes **timing control** and an **interrupt system** to minimize **software overhead**.

## Summary of specification for UART IP
In this section, I have summarized the key points from the "UART IP Specification" provided by the center. For further details, please refer to the full documents linked below:
